# Overview #

This project is an experiment to test the capabilities and resources of UChicago's Research Computing Center and the HathiTrust text database for Digital Humanities (DH) projects.  Special thanks to UChicago's Jeffrey Tharsen for administrative, logistical and technical guidance.

# Project Background #

The German word "Bildung" is one of the richer and harder-to-define words in the German lexicon.  The modern history of the word begins around 1750.  In general, it refers to a person's particular journey of self-culivation and self-directed development.  It is built upon strongly individualistic ideals, particularly the notion that each of us has a unique potential that requires us to chart our own particular path in life.  To speak of a person's "Bildung" is to describe his or her own journey of growth, maturation, and self-discovery.   
Around or before 1750, Bildung was usually used in a religious context, but since then has become secularized and gained many variants. In the 20th century, the idea of Bildung has been tied to problems as specific and concerte as the acquisition of useful vocational skills and as idealistic as cultural fluency and assimilation.  Because of its many uses, the term is uniquely well-suited to an analysis of its changing meaning and contexts over time.  This is what I propose to test using the HathiTrust database

# Release 1 #

The primary goal of the first release is to gather the raw information on which a more sophisticated analysis (e.g., natural language processing techniques) can be run. Over the entire HathiTrust database of German-language sources, I will find all instances where "Bildung" (and variations on the word) appears along with a 30-word "window" (15 words on each side) of context.  Other metadata collected about each occurrence will include the volume number and page number.
